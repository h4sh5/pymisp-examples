# pymisp-examples
Some example scripts for PyMISP, including searching last X days of data

This one uses python3.

## Usage

It's better if you use a virtualenv! But you don't have to.

Add your MISP URL and Auth Key in `keys.py`. You can leave the rest of the variables alone.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x main.py
./main.py
```
